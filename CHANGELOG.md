## 1.0.0

Bundles Firebird embedded for Android v. 5.0.3. Supported architectures:
- Arm32 (armeabi-v7a), 
- Arm64 (arm64-v8a),
- x64 (x86_64).

32-bit Intel architecture libraries from the Firebird embedded package are not bundled, because Flutter doesn't support this architecture and there is no point in inflating the package with those libraries.
